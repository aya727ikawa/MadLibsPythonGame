Purpose: This Python project is beginner friendly for software developers who are starting to learn Python for the first time and teaches the core computer science concepts like strings, variables, and concatenation. This Mad Libs Generator teaches to manipulate user-inputted data as the Mad Libs refer to a series of inputs that a user enters. The inputs come from the user and they can be anything from an adjective, a pronoun, or even a verb. After the user enters all the inputs, the application takes all the inputed data and arranges it to build a story template for "Dear Santa".
